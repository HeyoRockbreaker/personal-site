    <p>
    Welcome to my website! My name is Jacob Daddario, and I built this site using
    the <a href='https://rubyonrails.org/''>Ruby on Rails</a> framework. I am
    currently studying Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, and I am a
    self-taught programmer, a skill that I used to design this site. </br> </br> On this site,
    you can find my <a href='/contact'>contact information</a>, a résumé, as well as
    a variety of <a href='/posts'>blog posts</a> that are categorized by tag. Some of these posts are
    about my projets, others are about learning experiences that I've had, and
    others fall under whatever other categories interest me. That list tends to
    expand quickly, so make sure to click around the <a href='/posts'>blog postings</a> tab and see what
    interests you. If you'd like to learn more about my work expereiences, you can
    find a link to my résumé below.
    </p>
    <%= button_to 'My Résumé', pdfjs.full_path(file: "/resume.pdf"), class: 'button',
                                                        method: :get %>
  </div>
